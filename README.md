A sevice product which connects food donours and accepters


## Goal
Ending hunger and food waste within our lifetimes.

##Mission
Connect businesses with excess edible food to feed those in need, instantly.

##Overview
Our platform uses technology to streamline the process of food recovery and distribution, giving businesses and organizations the power to fight hunger and food waste within minutes. The application helps to minimize food wastage by effectively rescuing the excess food from weddings, parties, restaurants and temples and redeploying food resources in an efficient manner.

In this way, we wish to bridge the gap between these issues by connecting people and ensuring that the untouched left over food, can be distributed to people in need of food through reliable local NGO partners.

## Work flow
Share Food Users who have excess food post their details such as - location, time when the food was made, number of people, cuisine type and additional data.

Transport Food Anyone who can transport food, can contribute by delivering food from one location to another.

Request Food NGOs or people who manage orphanages/shelter homes can request for food based on their requirements.
